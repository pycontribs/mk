# Multi-repo actions

Since June 2024, `mk` project adopted the multi-repository commands from [pre]
project. The list of repositories is loaded from `~/.config/mk/mk.yml` that has
a format like below:

```yaml title="~/.config/mk/mk.yml"
repos:
  gh_org/gh_repo1: {}
  gh_org/gh_repo2: {}
```

You can use a symlink to store this file in a different location.

This feature is enabled only when all the below requirements are met:

- [gh] command is installed
- The config file is present on on disk

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

!!! note

    This feature is experimental and how it works might change between
    each new release, including command names and configuration file format.
    You are welcome to give your feedback about how we can make it more useful
    and flexible for most people.
